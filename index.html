The city was responsible for generating 15.8% of Mexico's GDP and the metropolitan area accounted for about 22% of total national GDP. As a stand-alone country, in 2013, Mexico City would be the fifth-largest economy in Latin Americaâ€”five times as large as Costa Rica and about the same size as Peru.

Mexicos capital is both the oldest capital city in the Americas and one of two founded by Native Americans, the other being Quito, Ecuador. The city was originally built on an island of Lake Texcoco by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan, which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan, and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards. In 1524, the municipality of Mexico City was established, known as Mexico Tenochtitlan, and as of 1585 it was officially known as Ciudad de Mexico (Mexico City). Mexico City served as the political, administrative and financial center of a major part of the Spanish colonial empire. After independence from Spain was achieved, the federal district was created in 1824.

<h1>Paseo de la Reforma</h1>
<p align="justify">
<a href=https://www.stockaereo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/114.00_00_00_00.Still001.jpg>Paseo de la Reforma</a> is a wide avenue that runs diagonally across the heart of Mexico City. It was designed by Ferdinand von Rosenzweig in the 1860s and modeled after the great boulevardsof Europe, such as the Ringstrasse in Vienna and the Champs-Elysees in Paris. After the French intervention in Mexico overthrew the constitutional President Benito Juarez, the newly crowned Emperor Maximilian made his mark on the conquered city. He commissioned a grand avenue linking the city center with his imperial residence, Chapultepec Castle, which was then on the southwestern edge of town. The project was originally named Paseo de la Emperatriz ("Promenade of the Empress") in honor of Maximilian's consort and second cousin Empress Carlota. After her return to Europe and Maximilian's subsequent execution, the restored Juarez government renamed the Paseo in honor of the Reform War.
<p align="justify">
It is now home to many of Mexico's tallest buildings such as the Torre Mayor and others in the Zona Rosa. More modern extensions continue the avenue at an angle to the old Paseo. To the northeast it continues toward Tlatelolco, where it changes its name near the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. There it divides into Calzada de Guadalupe and Calzada de los Misterios that continue toward La Villa. Its western portion going west from Chapultepec Park passes south of Polanco on its way through the affluent neighborhood of Lomas de Chapultepec and then into Cuajimalpa and Santa Fe on the outskirts of the city, although when it reaches this point it is more a highway than a promenade.

<h1>Coyoacan</h1>
<p align="justify">
<a href=https://i2.wp.com/lapetitevalisedaurelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/34_03.jpg>Coyoacan</a> refers to one of the 16 boroughs of the Federal District of Mexico City as well as the former village which is now the historic center of the boroughs. The name comes from Nahuatl and most likely means: place of coyotes. When the Aztecs named a pre-Hispanic village on the southern shore of Lake Texcoco which was dominated by the Tepanec people. Against Aztec domination, these people welcomed Hernan Cortes and the Spanish, who used the area as a headquarters during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and made it the first capital of New Spain between 1521 and 1523.
<p align="justify">
The village, later municipality, of Coyoacan remained completely independent of Mexico City through the colonial period into the 19th century. In 1857, the area was incorporated into the Federal District when this district was expanded. In 1928, the borough was created when the Federal District was divided into sixteen boroughs. The urban sprawl of Mexico City reached the borough in the mid 20th century, turning farms, former lakes and forests into developed areas, but many of the former villages have kept their original layouts, plazas and narrow streets and have conserved structures built from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. This has made the borough of Coyoacan, especially its historic center, a popular place to visit on weekends.is a wide avenue

<a href=https://a.travel-assets.com/findyours-php/viewfinder/images/res60/168000/168134-Xochimilco.jpg>Xochimilco</a>. In southern Mexico City, a gritty working-class neighborhood gives way to the famous canals of Xochimilco, the last remnants of a vast water transport system built by the Aztecs. Colorful gondola-like boats take visitors on cruises while food vendors, artisans and mariachi bands float past. The atmosphere is festive, especially on weekends. Tourists can also visit the eerie, purportedly haunted Island of the Dolls.This canal and chinampa system, as a vestige of the areas pre-Hispanic past, has made Xochimilco a World Heritage Site.
